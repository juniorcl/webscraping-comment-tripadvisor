# WebScraping Comment Tripadivasor
A study project who aims to create a web scarping for getting informations about comments on the site.

## About
This project is for studying purpose. It was created during the lessons about web scraping. The lessons are part of the course [Data Science do Zero](https://minerandodados.com.br/curso-de-data-science/). The page which was used as base for web scraping is about Parque Barigui, a park from Curitiba, PR - Brazil. It can be found at this [link](https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Attraction_Review-g303441-d553398-Reviews-Parque_Barigui-Curitiba_State_of_Parana.html) on the Tripadvisor website. The web scrapping takes the author of the comment, the title, the local of the author and the comment.

The spider was coded on the python version 3.7.6 and Scrapy version 2.1.0.

## How Does It Work?
This project was made for the web page cited above. However, you can adapt the code for another page. For running the code you need to execute the command: 

> scrapy crawl comentario
